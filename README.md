# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

DISCLAIMER: This repository is created to store all the necessary files for the completion of Getting and Cleaning Data Module of the Data Science Course.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The link below pertains to the data set used in this course project:

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Overall, the project requires
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
4. A README.md in the repo with the scripts

## PROJECT GOALS (R SCRIPT)
At the end of the project, one R script called run_analysis.R should be able to do the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

## PROJECT FILES GUIDE
Inside the repository are the following files:
1. "README.md" - contains the overview of the whole project and the requirements
2. "CodeBook.md" -  contains information on the variables, data set, transformations and work that was done to tidy up the data
3. "run_analysis.R" -  contains the code used to complete the project goals
4. "TidyData.txt" - is the output of the R script, run_analysis.R.
